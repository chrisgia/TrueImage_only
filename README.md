# TrueImage_only

Little Powershell script to kill every Acronis process that is not related with the main function of True Image 2021, which is to make backups.

I recommend turning off the protection inside True Image before executing this script (Open Acronis True Image 2021 -> PROTECTION -> "Turn off protection").
